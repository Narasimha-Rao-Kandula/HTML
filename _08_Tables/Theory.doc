                        Tables

    |- to display our data interms of rows and columns
    |- which is helpful to identify easily

<table>  -- creates a table
|- table data created interms rows ( row by row)
        |- Attributes : 
        |- border --- border to the table data
            |- Note: no need to mention the units (px,%,em)
        |- span  --- increasing its either width / height
            |- colspan  --- column span --> expand across the rows
            |- rowspan  --- row span    --> expand across the columns
        |- align  -- position of the text {left(dafult),center, right}
        |- cellpadding --- space btw border and text (cellpadding = "0" (default))

    |- <caption> -- provides the title of table in center

    |- <colgroup> --- column group --- a set of columns

|- Tables      --- thead, tbody, tfoot

    |- Table Head --- <thead> -- heading such as idno, name, section
        |- <th> (recommended) / <td>
        |- difference ?
            |- th --- text will be bold, text aligned at center
            |- td --- text will be normal, text aligned at left
        |- Note:
